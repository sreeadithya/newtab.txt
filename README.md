yo welcome to newtab.txt

its an ultra simple and lightweight product that iâ€™ve built where you can just write shit down in the new tab. works on basically any browser and without an internet connection.\
developing this was definitely a challenge since i'm very inexperienced with programming but i hope that anyone who stumbles upon this finds this useful. thank you!

i wont be developing this further since i feel the product has all the features it needs to have considering its aesthetic and what i set out to make.


to install:

1. download the latest .zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/sreeadithya/newtab.txt/releases)
2. go to the extensions page in your browser (chrome://extensions or edge://extensions or opera://extensions)
3. turn on developer mode in the top right corner
4. drag and drop that .zip


do let me know of any bugs and i'd love to work on fixing them
