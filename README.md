yo welcome to newtab.txt

its an ultra simple and lightweight product that i’ve built where you can just write shit down in the new tab. i want to make it so that its something i would use on a daily basis. it'll take a while to get to the final 1.0 release since i'm very inexperienced with html, css and js but i think it'll be worth the while. stuff will be rolled out soon!

✦ all your text is stored to the chrome storage and doesn’t leave your computer, it’ll stay there even if you close the tab.\
✦ `ctrl + b` in order to blur the screen to act as a privacy filter for when you're afk\
✦ more features to be added soon!

to install:

    download the latest .zip from the releases page
    go to chrome://extentions in the address bar
    turn on developer mode in the top right corner
    drag and drop that .zip

so its in a really early stage and only a tiny part of the featureset has been implemented

stuff that's still on the roadmap:

    hover to left side of screen in order to show tiny menu
    darkmode toggle
    change it to work on javascript instead of html textarea so that future features can be possible

    typing hashtag creates a task
    convert links into links
    bold italic and underline
    bullet points

    font changer
    download functionality
