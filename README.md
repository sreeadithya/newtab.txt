yo welcome to newtab.txt

its a simple product that i’ve built where you can just write shit down in the new tab. its been done better but i want to give it a shot nonetheless.

all your text is stored to the chrome storage and doesn’t leave your computer, it’ll stay there even if you close the tab.

to install:

    download the latest .zip from the releases page
    go to chrome://extentions in the address bar
    turn on developer mode in the top right corner
    drag and drop that .zip

so its in a really early stage and only a tiny part of the featureset has been implemented

stuff that's still on the roadmap:

    typing hashtag creates a task
    convert links into clickable links
    bold italic and underline
    bullet points
    blur the screen with shortcut
    a hover-to-reveal minimalistic sidebar
    darkmode toggle
    font changer
    ability to download the text

it'll take a while since i'm very inexperienced with html, css and js but i think it'll be worth the while. stuff will be rolled out in the coming days.
