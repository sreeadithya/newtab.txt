yo welcome to newtab.txt

its an ultra simple and lightweight product that i’ve built where you can just write shit down in the new tab. 1.0 has just released and i really love how it has turned out. developing this was definitely a challenge since i'm very inexperienced with programming. i hope that anyone who stumbles upon this finds this useful. thank you!\
i wont be developing this further since i feel the product has all the features it needs to have considering its requirement and aesthetic.\

✦ all your text is stored to the chrome storage and doesn’t leave your computer, it’ll stay there even if you close the tab.\
✦ hover to the top left of the screen for the sidebar!\
✦ ability to use darkmode and download the text as a .txt file\
✦ change the font to fit your aesthetic\
✦ `ctrl + b` in order to blur the screen to act as a privacy filter for when you're afk\

to install:

    download the latest .zip from the releases page
    go to chrome://extentions in the address bar
    turn on developer mode in the top right corner
    drag and drop that .zip

so its in a really early stage and only a tiny part of the featureset has been implemented

stuff that's still on the roadmap:

    hover to left side of screen in order to show tiny menu
    darkmode toggle
    change it to work on javascript instead of html textarea so that future features can be possible

    typing hashtag creates a task
    convert links into links
    bold italic and underline
    bullet points

    font changer
    download functionality
